# youtube-dl-GUI
A simple and minimalistic GUI for the [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) command-line tool for Windows that allows the user to download any YouTube video in any quality and framerate (up to 8K 60FPS, if available) with lossless quality!

The GUI is very basic and easy to use. It is meant for people who are not comfortable with the command-line (or simply don't want to use it) that just want an easy way to download YouTube videos with no restrictions or bloat.

## Setup
All you need to do is download the latest release `.zip` and extract the contents to a folder of your choice. Everything you need is included in the `.zip`. Just run the `youtube-dl-GUI.exe`. Simple as that!

If you already have FFmpeg installed on your system you can download the `-noFFmpeg` version of the release.

## Note
**The `youtube-dl.exe` must be in the same directory as `youtube-dl-GUI.exe` in order to function.**
