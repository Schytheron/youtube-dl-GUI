# youtube-dl-GUI
A simple GUI for the youtube-dl command-line program for Windows (https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).

# Setup
Dowload the latest `youtube-dl` Windows release (`youtube-dl.exe`) from https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html and place it into the same directory as `youtube-dl-GUI.exe`, alternatively you can update the existing version of `youtube-dl.exe` that comes with this GUI release by clicking the "Update" button in the GUI itself.

# Note
**The `youtube-dl.exe` must be placed in the same directory as `youtube-dl-GUI` in order to function.**

**In order to download higher quality videos (greater than 720p) you must have FFmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed on your system. Reason being that higher quality videos on YouTube are split into separate video and audio files. Therefore these files must be merged together into a single video file. This must be done by external tools such as FFmpeg.**
