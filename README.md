# youtube-dl-GUI
A simple GUI for the youtube-dl command-line program for Windows (https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).

# Note
**The `youtube-dl.exe` must be placed in the same directory as `youtube-dl-GUI` in order to function properly.**

In order to download higher quality videos (greater than 720p) you must have FFmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed on your system. Reason being that higher quality videos on YouTube are split into separate video and audio files. Therefore these files must be merged together into a single video file. This must be done by external tools such as FFmpeg.
